PIC Microcontroller Projects: Assembly Language for PIC18F452
Welcome to a comprehensive collection of PIC18F452 projects developed using assembly language. These projects are crafted for implementation with Proteus and MPLAB IDE, utilizing the assembly programming language to provide a detailed understanding of PIC microcontroller functionality.

Materials Required:
Proteus Software
MPLAB IDE
PIC18F452 Microcontroller
Assembly Programming Language Skills
How to Use:
Create a New Project:
Initiate a new project in MPLAB IDE, selecting the target platform as PIC18F452.

Add ASM Source File:
Within the created project, incorporate the assembly source file containing the code for the specific project.

Assemble the Code:
Assemble the code using MPLAB IDE to generate the corresponding hex file, essential for uploading into the PIC18F452 microcontroller.

Upload Hex File:
Use a suitable programmer or tool to upload the generated hex file into the PIC18F452 microcontroller.

Simulation Testing:
Thoroughly test the projects in simulations using the Proteus software to ensure reliable and accurate results.

Table of Content:
Project 1: 7 Segment Display
Display numbers from 00 to 99 with advanced features like clearing the screen and stopping the numbers (similar to a stopwatch). This project utilizes interrupts for enhanced efficiency.

Project 2: Number Display with Polling
Display numbers using the polling method, although not recommended for modern microcontrollers. Manual incrementation is done through an external button.

Project 3: Keypad Interfacing
Interface a matrix of switches with a 7-segment display. When a button is pressed, the associated number is displayed on the 7-segment.

Project 4: Shift LEDs
Shift LEDs one by one from the Least Significant Bit (LSB) to the Most Significant Bit (MSB).

Important Notes:
Code Modification:
Feel free to modify and improve the code if any issues or bugs are encountered. The projects are open for customization to meet specific requirements.

Testing and Verification:
It is highly recommended to test the projects in a simulation environment before deploying them onto physical hardware to identify and address potential issues.

Community Collaboration:
Enhance and optimize the projects? Share your improvements with the community to foster collaboration and the development of more robust PIC microcontroller applications.
